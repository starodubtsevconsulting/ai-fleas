# AI Fleas Rules

* Admin can do everything. This overrides all other rules that apply to Admin.

## AI Fleas can

* AI Fleas can contain reusable commands under `ai-commands/`.
* AI Fleas can contain reusable workflows, roles, and governance under `ai-workflows/`.
* AI Fleas can contain profile structure, documentation, validation, and sanitized examples under `ai-profile/`.
* AI Fleas can use local or Git-ignored operational profiles without making them part of the public repository.
* AI Fleas can use platform-specific adapters selected explicitly by the profile and `agent_platform`.
* AI Fleas can initialize a workflow when the profile, workflow, project, work target, and platform are known.
* AI Fleas can use host/platform companion repositories only when explicitly selected by the profile or human.
* AI Fleas can modify another repository only when the human explicitly identifies it and the host permits access.

## AI Fleas cannot

* AI Fleas cannot contain real profiles, credentials, secrets, client/private-provider information, machine-specific paths, or runtime state.
* AI Fleas cannot depend on AI Fleas Platform or another host implementation; platforms may depend on AI Fleas instead.
* AI Fleas cannot infer a profile, workflow, project, platform, command, repository, or companion from nearby files, names, previous tasks, or memory.
* AI Fleas cannot operate outside the configured project root unless the human explicitly requests another repository and access is permitted.
* AI Fleas cannot initialize or mutate agents when required profile, workflow, project, platform, or command configuration is missing or conflicting.
* AI Fleas cannot use real client, organization, person, project, or machine names in public examples.
* AI Fleas cannot duplicate command or workflow IDs.
